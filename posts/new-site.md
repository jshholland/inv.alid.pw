I've finally updated my personal homepage!  Highlights include
up-to-date information about myself, a switch from Jekyll to Hakyll,
and ditching Bootstrap for hand-coded CSS.  I have some intent to
actually post things to the blog in the future also, but whether that
happens does remain to be seen.

Still to be done are re-implementing some sort of mobile/responsive
design, adding a more formal CV, generating an RSS feed, and perhaps
even a publication list.  There are also no doubt plenty of places
that could use a little prettification; I make no claims to being
talented at web design.
