Mark Dominus points out that the Classical [Princess Andromeda],
rescued by Perseus from Cetus, was in fact an Aethiopian princess, and
therefore extremely unlikely to be the white maiden often depicted in
Western art.  On the other hand, Wikipedia [points out] that Aethiopia
(or more properly Αἰθιοπία, deriving from 'sun-burnt') is distinct
from modern Ethiopia, and is a general designation for 'the land of
dark people', which could be anything from modern Ethiopia to India or
Indonesia.
