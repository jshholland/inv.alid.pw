title: Shined or shone?

Reading [Slate Star Codex] today, a sentence in a quote jumped out at
me:

> The changes ... shined a national spotlight

In particular, the usage of "shined" over "shone" seemed very
unnatural to me.  As a result of doing a little research on this, both
words have now completely [lost any meaning].  I hope that someone
reads this blog post so it was all worth it.

My first stop was the entry on Wiktionary, which lists both "shined"
and "shone" as equally acceptable simple past or participle forms.  I
didn't think that this was quite right, so I continued my digging.  A
search for "shined or shone" revealed the usual mass of grammar blogs.
The top result was [Grammarist], which has a very short entry saying
that historically, "shone" was for something emitting light, and
"shined" was for polishing something, although in modern usage this is
less strictly adhered to.  Most other results had a similar, although
not quite the same, transitive vs intransitive distinction.  One even
mentioned a mnemonic "rhyme": "shone stands alone".

I put "rhyme" in scare quotes there because in my (British English RP)
accent it doesn't rhyme at all: "shone" as in "gone" and "alone" as in
"moan".  This reinforces my initial intuition that there is some
British vs American difference here.  Inspired by my favourite blog
about such differences, [Separated by a Common Language], whose post
on this I only thought to search for after doing all this other
research myself, I looked up the two words in a [corpus]:

![GloWbE search for shined](/img/shined.png){ width=100% }
![GloWbE search for shone](/img/shone.png){ width=100% }

And there we have it: "shone" is proportionally much more common in
British (and Commonwealth) English than it is in American.  Now you
should go read that [SbaCL][Separated by a Common Language] post
because it's written by someone who actually studies this stuff for a
living.
