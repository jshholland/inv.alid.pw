[Yet another fun Turing-completeness proof](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1904.09828.pdf);
the undecidability is of course via a reduction to the Halting Problem.

Since apparently these links posts are just 'Things that shouldn't be TC
but are', another Turing-complete game is [Baba is You] (which I haven't
played yet, but all reviews indicate that it is very good).

Relatedly(?), an Essex man has set the record for the [land speed record
in a tuk-tuk].

The [Voynich manuscript] has (once again) allegedly been [deciphered],
although it seems likely that this is incorrect.  [Ars Technica] and
[Language Log] analyse this most recent attempt.

[The Persistence of Chaos] is an art piece consisting of an airgapped
2008 laptop 'running 6 pieces of malware that have caused financial
damages totaling $95B'.  It was auctioned off for $1.345M.
