Once again the House of Commons has infuriated me sufficiently that I
felt the need to contact my MP.  Once again, I am publishing my
correspondence in the hope that it normalises people beyond the
stereotypical 'green ink brigade' to [write to them].

I am (for the moment) in Worcester, so it's a different MP (and a
different party) to last time, but that means little.

> The decision of your party's Government to prorogue Parliament is a

Again I have forgotten to mention recent protests.  Perhaps I will
have the opportunity to vote against him soon anyway; who can possibly
say in such times.
