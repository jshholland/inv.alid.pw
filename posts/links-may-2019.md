The New Yorker reports on the fascinating [discovery] of a site which
may preserve the day of the Chixculub impact, often blamed for the
K-T extinction.  Of course there are criticisms and doubts, but I'm sure
that this is an important site regardless.

What does that famous black hole picture actually represent?

[This] ([non-video link]) is one of the most perverse uses of a computer
I have ever seen.  The insane mind behind it, [Tom 7], has also produced
a number of other mind-melting projects, including a [C compiler which
produces executables consisting only of ASCII printable bytes][compiler].

Super Tux Kart, a totally original game that is in no way inspired by
any other kart racing games, which I used to play when I first got into
Linux about 10 years ago, is apparently still being developed and just
had its [1.0 release][supertuxkart] which includes netplay.

Slate Star Codex [recounts] the theories of human population modeller
Heinz von Foerster's 1960 paper and postulates mechanisms around the
interactions of population growth, technological progress and the economy.
The real interplay is no doubt far too complicated for us to understand,
but this seems like a reasonable approximation.

[Lashon Hara] is the proscribed Jewish concept of 'Evil Tongue' (link
via [David MacIver]).  Especially in the context of modern social media,
mindfulness about what one is saying and, more importantly, what purpose
saying it serves is vital, especially since we haven't really internalised
the dynamics of a massive public discourse arena.

Readers may have heard of the 3750-year-old Babylonian [tablet]
complaining of a copper merchant's inferior quality ingots and rude
treatment of his messenger.  What is less well-known is that (perhaps
inevitably) this has led to a certain amount of [slash fiction] (NSFW
text) being written about Ea-nasir and Nanni.  AO3 has no fewer than
[6 other stories] inspired by this tablet. (This one via [Mark Dominus].)
