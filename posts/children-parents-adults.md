title: Children, parents and adults
---

I mostly learned to drive from my dad, but after I passed my test (like
many others in the UK) I did a Pass Plus course subsidised by the local
council.  It covered things like motorway driving and handling unusual
weather, but it was also interesting to learn from another instructor.

One thing I learned in this course was that there are three different
types of drivers: children, parents and adults.  Of course the names
don't relate to the actual age or familial situation of the drivers,
but their approach to the road.  Recently I've realised that it's a
useful mental taxonomy to have around in other situations as well.

Children are in a selfish rush to get wherever it is they are going,
with no real appreciation or concern for those around them: the boy
racers trying to impress the girl in the passenger seat, the elderly
people who really shouldn't still be driving, and everyone who has
had one too many drink trying to get home from the pub.  Obviously
this is not something to emulate.

The parents focus above all on worrying about the children.  They are
most susceptible to road rage, and will often pay less attention to 
their own driving than tutting at the driver who just overtook on the
inside at 85 mph.  They know better than the children, but not better
enough just to take care of themselves.

Obviously, then, we want to be adults: safe and sensible drivers in
our own right, and allowing the children a wide enough berth to grow up
without our oversight (and without crashing into us!).

I'll leave it up to you to find examples of this trichotomy.  It comes
up surprisingly often, and I think it's probably some fairly fundamental
mode of human behaviour.  It's also a good reminder that you want to be
an adult rather than any of the other two, and not get too caught up in
the moment.
