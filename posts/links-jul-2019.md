If anyone has been wondering what Tom DeLonge has been up to since he left
Blink-182 in 2014, it turns out he founded the [To The Stars Academy of
Arts and Science], which mostly seems to focus on collecting UFO videos
and images.  Unfortunately, a 2018 [SEC report] stated that it 'has
incurred losses from operations and has an accumulated deficit at June
30, 2018 of $37,432,000. These factors raise doubt about the Company's
ability to continue as a going concern', so I guess someone else will
have to save us from the alien menace or the secret US government spy
planes or whatever these UFOs really are.

IRC/Slack/Discord replacement/competitor Matrix has [released as 1.0].
I think I want this to work, since IRC has problems, and have had a
rambly draft on the matter for quite a while.  But see also Drew DeVault
on why the [lack of features in IRC is a feature].

['Sega Toylet'] is frankly an amazing brand name, although I'm not sure
whether it should really exist as a commercial product.  At least there
is no Sonic tie-in (yet?).

A fascinating but sad feature on the likely fate of [Malaysia Airlines
Flight MH370] from pilot-turned-journalist William Langewiesche.

After many years of resistance, I recently started using an adblocker,
due to articles like [these] [two] from an ex-adtech worker.  Back in
2015, [Idle Words] predicted the bursting of the adtech bubble, and 
I'm now trying to avoid using services that rely on advertising for
their business model.  My preference for free software (self-hosted or
otherwise) followed by an upfront paid service puts me in mind of
[David R Maciver's excellent _How to write good software_], which I
more-or-less entirely agree with.

In the frontier days of the Western US from the 1890s to 1930s, the
unpredictability of mining towns springing up or going bust meant that
it was hard for churches to be established.  The solution that some
came up with was the [railroad chapel car]: simply take a regular train
carriage, add an altar and some pews, put it on a train to wherever the
people are, then leave it in a siding until the mine runs dry and cart
it off somewhere else.
