title: "How to Write Good: Fowler's Modern English Usage and Hart's Rules"
---

I've been doing a lot of writing recently, and often questions of
style and typography have arisen.  Thus far, I've been making use of
online resources such at Butterick's [Practical Typography] or [the
Guardian style guide] to steer me in the right direction, but the
latter is not fully detailed, and the former often makes American
choices where I would prefer a British style.  Also of note is the
[MHRA style guide], although I'm not sure to what extent it is
applicable outside the humanities.

Two of the most well-known British style guides are _A Dictionary of
Modern English Usage_ (aka _Fowler's Modern English Usage_ or just
_Fowler's_) and _New Hart's Rules_.  It was unclear on the
distinctions between them, so I bought both.
