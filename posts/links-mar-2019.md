title: Links for March 2019

This is the first monthly-ish collection of interesting links I have
read online, with some thoughts about each one.  There aren't as many
as there might usually be in this one because I only started
collecting them this week.

David R. MacIver writes about '[the Core Problem with
Democracy](https://notebook.drmaciver.com/posts/2019-02-27-12:03.html)'.
Under some (unrealistic?) independence assumptions, a vote on 'A and
B' may fail, even if most of the population individually believe A and
B.  I wonder how related this is to [Simpson's
paradox](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Simpson%27s_paradox).  The
conclusion includes the interesting observation that democracy often
conflates values ('how should the world look?') and judgement ('how do
we make the world look that way?').  Robin Hanson's
'[futarchy](http://mason.gmu.edu/~rhanson/futarchy.html)' responds to
this distinction, and so does Scott Alexander's fictional [Shining
Garden](https://slatestarcodex.com/2013/05/06/raikoth-laws-language-and-society/).

Today's 'don't believe anything you read on the internet' article:
[Gizmodo](https://gizmodo.com/the-fake-sex-doctor-who-conned-the-media-into-publicizi-1832711205)
exposes 'Dr.' David Sendler, whose studies have led to articles in
places from Forbes to [Savage
Lovecast](https://www.savagelovecast.com/), as a 'serial fabulist'.
I'm not sure whether the widespread media coverage he has attracted or
the possibility that he is fraudulently seeing (potentially very
vulnerable) patients is more concerning.  The way he talks about his
upcoming study on suicide, on subjects he found by searching social
media(!), are particularly alarming.

[Commento](https://commento.io/) is a Disqus-like commenting platform
which emphasises privacy and speed.  A paid hosted version is
available, but it's
[open-source](https://gitlab.com/commento/commento) and so
self-hosting is an option (and now operational on this site, after
much faffing with probably pointless Content-Security-Policy options).
I hadn't enabled comments here before because I don't particularly
trust a service like Disqus, and other solutions are a pain with a
statically generated site.  The one hesitation I had before installing
Commento is being slightly distrustful of requiring Javascript, which
was previously only 'necessary' to view rendered MathJax, which
somewhat gracefully degrades to the raw TeX code.  Also, in 2019, it
doesn't seem too onerous to require JS for something non-essential
like comments.
