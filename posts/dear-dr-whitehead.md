After the House of Commons [voted] last night for 'indicative votes',
there has probably never been a better time to [write to your MP],
regardless of your opinions on Brexit or the Government's handling of
it.  Representative democracy works best when the representatives know
what their constituents want, and they can only do that if we tell
them.  Below is what I wrote: feel free to critique or use it
as inspiration for your own correspondence.

Having now sent and re-read it, I'm slightly annoyed that I forgot to
mention the [People's March] and the [petition], but maybe it's better
to keep things short and to the point.  I can only now hope that
Parliament can finally get things unstuck and make some forward
progress.
