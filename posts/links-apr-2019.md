[Berkson's paradox](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Berkson's_paradox)
is a counterintuitive result which most often manifests as falsely
observing a negative correlation between independent variables when
one mistakenly only sees cases when at least one of them occurs.
Wikipedia's example: 'For example, a person may observe from their
experience that fast food restaurants in their area which serve good
hamburgers tend to serve bad fries and vice versa; but because they
would likely not eat anywhere where both were bad, they fail to allow
for the large number of restaurants in this category which would
weaken or even flip the correlation.'

'Why are you reading about [airships]?' 'Because airships are cool.'
Back-of-the-envelope calculations (admittedly by an airship blog)
suggest that giant cargo airships could be a trillion dollar industry
(the calculations are rough enough that what we mean by that doesn't
matter: could be market cap, revenue, value of assets...).
