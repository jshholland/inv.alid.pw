title: When should we punish?
---

Today is [another post](/posts/shined-shone) inspired by
[SlateStarCodex], albeit this time in a rather more substantive way.
It's also relevant to a conversation I had with a friend a few weeks
ago, but here's the quote from Scott Alexander:

> A while ago, I learned that my great-grandfather was murdered, and
> my great-grandmother – normally a deeply kind and compassionate
> woman – demanded the death penalty rather than life imprisonment for
> his murderers. When the jury went with life imprisonment anyway, she
> yelled at them that she hoped someone killed their loved ones so
> they knew how it felt. This story had a pretty big impact on me and
> made me try to generate examples of things that could happen such
> that I would really want the perpetrators to suffer, even more than
> consequentialism demanded. I may have turned some very nasty and
> imaginative parts of my brain, the ones that wrote the Broadcast
> interlude in Unsong, to imagining crimes perfectly calculated to
> enrage me. And in the end I did it. I broke my brain to the point
> where I can very much imagine certain things that would happen and
> make me want the perpetrator to suffer – not infinitely, but not
> zero either. I am not going to claim that this is just some
> misfiring of evolutionary urges which I obviously denounce. I think
> I stick to them the same way I stick to liking kittens. I’m not sure
> I would promote them as policy – in the same kind of second-level
> way where I can think of some people who would make good dictators
> but still don’t actually want them to set up a dictatorship – but I
> don’t renounce them entirely either. I guess reflective equilibrium
> is easier to disturb than I thought.
