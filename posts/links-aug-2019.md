Again I'm a few days late with these links.  I hope nobody has been
kept up all night worrying.

The Fediverse is a network of mostly-compatible software that got a
big spike a couple of years ago as part of a Twitter backlash; the
software that runs [my instance], recently hit its [1.0 release].

GPG/PGP has long been derided for its complete failure to penetrate
the mainstream.  This is mostly due to its terrible UX, bending
over backwards to support old crypto, and trying to be jack of all
trades, master of none, as explained in this [excellent blog post].
Some of the recommended alternatives are better than others.  [Magic
Wormhole], new to me, seems like an extremely useful tool to have in
one's back pocket.

['Caution! Functor! Keep 2m
back.'](https://golem.ph.utexas.edu/category/2012/01/vorsicht_funktor.html)
A common response to category theory.

[General Butt Naked] sounds like he should come from a Far Cry game or
something, but was actually a horrifying Liberian warlord who claimed
to have killed over 20,000 people and fought nude because he believed
it would protect him from bullets.  However, in 1996 he converted to
Christianity after a vision of Christ told him to repent and his since
become a preacher, even at one point expressing his willingness to be
tried at the Hague.  While this might give hope that anyone can be
reformed, he still claims that he was under Satanic influence during
his rampages, which probably takes something away from it.

In 1809, a man made a bet that he could make any house in London into
the most talked about address in a week.  The result was the [Berners
Street hoax], in which he requested more or less every tradesman in
London come to 57 Berners Street to provide their services to a Mrs
Tottenham.  Even the Lord Mayor of London turned up!

A slightly less famous English mayor is that [of High Wycombe].  This
is a shame, because due to some historically corrupt, drunken and
generally useless incumbents, each outgoing mayor is 'tolled out' by
the ringing of the city bells, and subsequently weighed to ensure that
they have not gained any weight at the taxpayers' expense.

Today's feel-good story to end: the world of [competitive dog surfing].
