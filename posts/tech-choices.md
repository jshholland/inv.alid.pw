title: It's all about ethics in chat networks
---

Recently, I realised that I've been using IRC for over ten years.  In
that time period, the number of ways to do instant messaging has grown
quite rapidly: Slack, Discord, Telegram, WhatsApp, Messenger, Signal,
Matrix.org, and more have all come into existence since then and
reached some level of use, and Jabber/XMPP is still around too.  Some
of these are proprietary and under the control of a single company;
others are open source and federated.  There's also [IRCv3], which I'm
not even sure where it fits into all this.

I have accounts on and regularly use all of the mentioned messaging
systems, and I still use regular old SMS messaging quite frequently as
well.  IRC is certainly feeling its age: the hassle of running a
bouncer or command line client in a screen session somewhere is a high
bar to set to be some approximation of always online, and it doesn't
support some of the features of reaction emoji, threading or embedded
images nearly as well as its more modern competitors such as Slack and
Discord.  But I really can't see it dying any time soon.  Most IRCers
at this point have been around for a long time.
