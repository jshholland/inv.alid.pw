title: Tech choices and the reasons behind them
---

Recently, I realised that I've been using IRC for something very close
to ten years.  In that time period, the number of ways to do instant
messaging has grown quite rapidly: Slack, Discord, Telegram, WhatsApp,
Messenger, Signal, Matrix.org, and more have all come into existence
since then and reached some level of use, and Jabber/XMPP is still
around too.  Some of these are proprietary and under the control of a
single company; others are open source and federated.  There's also
[IRCv3], which I'm not even sure where it fits into all this.

This is par for the course in today's world of software.  Perhaps the
network effects of communication and social networks have some impact,
but almost every possible choice one can make about what to use to
accomplish something on the internet is similar to the one we make
when we decide how to have an online conversation.  It's not just at
the level of user either: a sysadmin has to choose between hosting
providers, a developer between programming frameworks, database
engines, and version control systems, and managers have to pick their
favourite set of buzzwords.

Often we end up using certain things purely out of familiarity and
habit, or for the opposite reason of novelty and curiosity, without
particularly thinking about whether they are the right tool for the
job or not.
