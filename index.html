        In the day, I write <a href="http://puppetlabs.com/">Puppet</a> code
        to deploy software such as <a href="http://icinga.org">Icinga</a>
        and <a href="http://drupal.org">Drupal</a>, using <a href="http://git-scm">
        git</a> for version control. At evenings and weekends, I try to improve my
        <a href="http://en.lichess.org/@/jshholland">chess skills</a>, pretend I
        know what I am doing with a camera (with both terrestrial and celestial
        subjects) and stress myself out playing
