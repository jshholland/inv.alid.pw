## About me

In the day, I spend most of my time writing [Puppet] code to deploy
software such as [Icinga] and [Drupal]. At evenings and weekends, I try to
improve my [chess] skills, pretend I know what I am doing with a camera
(with both terrestrial and celestial subjects) and try to teach myself
more languages (both human and computer) than I really have time for.

I can usually be found on IRC as `dutchie` on [Freenode] and elsewhere,
and can be reached by email at <josh@inv.alid.pw>.
