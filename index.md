# About me

My name is Josh Holland, and I'm currently a PhD student at the
University of Southampton.  I am investigating ways to use the string
diagrams of symmetric monoidal category theory to model systems of
computation such as signal flow graphs and Petri nets.  For a friendly
introduction, see [Graphical Linear Algebra], the blog run by my
supervisor, Paweł Sobociński.

Before I started my PhD, I worked for [Sirius], an independent IT
contractor based in the South of England specialising in open source
solutions, and prior to that I studied Mathematics at Keble College,
Oxford as my undergraduate degree, culminating in an MMath.  I grew up
in Worcester, in the West Midlands of the UK.

My extra-curricular interests include music, tabletop games, and
languages.  I sing with the [Southampton Philharmonic Choir],
representing the student body as Secretary of the SU Phil.  As well as
my personal collection of board games, I play Go and [Yomi] online,
uploading tournament games of the latter to my [YouTube] channel.  As
well studying languages for practical use, I am interested in
languages which exemplify radically different foundations to my native
English, particularly conlangs.  To that end, I have spent some time
learning [Lojban], [Toki Pona] and [Esperanto]; I regularly attend the
meetings of the [Southampton Esperanto Group], whose website I
maintain and host.
