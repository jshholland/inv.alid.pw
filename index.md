# About me

My name is Josh Holland, and I'm currently a PhD student at the
University of Southampton.  I am investigating ways to use the string
diagrams of symmetric monoidal category theory to model systems of
computation such as signal flow graphs and Petri nets.  For a friendly
introduction, see [Graphical Linear Algebra], the blog run by my
supervisor, Paweł Sobociński.

Before I started my PhD, I worked for [Sirius], an independent IT
contractor based in the South of England specialising in open source
solutions, and prior to that I studied Mathematics at Keble
College, Oxford as my undergraduate degree, culminating in an MMath.

You can get in touch with me via the social media links on the left,
or by emailing me: <josh@inv.alid.pw>.
