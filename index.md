# Josh Holland
{: .page-header}

I'm a former student of Mathematics at Keble
College, Oxford, and currently working for [Sirius
Corporation] in Surrey.

In the day, I write [Puppet] code to deploy software such as [Icinga]
and [Drupal], using [git] for version control. At evenings and weekends,
I try to improve my [chess] skills, pretend I know what I am doing with
a camera (with both terrestrial and celestial subjects) and stress myself
out playing Awesomenauts.
