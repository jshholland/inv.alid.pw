This site is produced with the [Jekyll] static site generator, using
[Grunt] to auto-build and minify CSS. The source code is on Github
[here][source]. The typeface is [Quando], served from Google Fonts. Also
in use are icons from the [Glyphicons] Halflings set, kindly provided
for free as part of [Bootstrap].


It is served by an [nginx] server running on [Debian], hosted at [BitFolk].
